# BehavePassUAM

[BehavePassUAM](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bida.behavepassdbuam) has been developed by the BiDA-Lab research group of the Autonomous University of Madrid for the acquisition of a database that allows studying the interaction with mobile devices. The stored data does not include personal information and will be used for research purposes.

The study consists of carrying out a series of simple tasks that are part of the usual interaction with our smartphones. The tasks are completed in less than 2 minutes and will be repeated during 4 sessions, with a time frame of at least 1 day between sessions.
